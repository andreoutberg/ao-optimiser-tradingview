## [v0.8.0] - 2025-01-09 - Dual Mode System with Profitability Validation

### 🎉 Major Milestone: Advanced Statistical Analysis Implementation

**This release implements a sophisticated dual-mode system with profit-validated filtering - a significant advancement in algorithmic trading strategy development.**

### ⚡ Added - Dual Mode System
- **Optimised Mode**: Fully automated TP/SL calculation with profitability validation
- **Custom Mode**: Manual threshold control with historical validation
- **Profitability Simulation Engine**: Validates setups using historical trade simulation
- **Expected Success Rate Calculation**: Predicts win rate for optimised levels
- **Split Validation Method**: Uses separate data sets for calculation vs validation
- **Mode-specific Dashboard**: Different displays for optimised vs custom modes

### ✅ Added - Enhanced Filtering Logic
- **Profit Validation**: Only executes trades when historical simulation predicts profitability
- **Risk/Reward Automation**: Automatic validation that SL < TP2 for positive expectancy
- **Dynamic SL Methods**: Historical average (optimised) vs DD limit (custom)
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Minimum profit requirements and data quality checks

### 🔧 Added - System Improvements
- **Simplified Settings**: Removed manual toggles for cleaner user experience
- **Always-On Features**: Strict validation, 2% position sizing, continuous data tracking
- **Enhanced Alerts**: Mode-specific information in alert messages
- **Improved Debug System**: Additional plots for profitability and success rate tracking

### 🎯 Changed - Configuration Approach
- **Position Size**: Fixed at 2% (adjustable in Properties tab)
- **Signal Validation**: Always strict (no toggle)
- **Historical Tracking**: Always enabled (no toggle)  
- **Filter Selection**: Mode dropdown determines validation approach

### 🔍 Technical Implementation
- **Profitability Engine**: Simulates historical trades using calculated TP/SL levels
- **Statistical Confidence**: Requires minimum sample sizes for reliable calculations
- **Memory Management**: Optimised array operations for historical data
- **Scope Declarations**: Fixed Pine Script v6 compilation issues

### 📊 Dashboard Enhancements
- **Optimised Mode Display**: Shows profitability, risk/reward, expected success rate
- **Custom Mode Display**: Shows TP1 success, level validation, drawdown compliance
- **Real-time Updates**: Live calculation of filter status and performance metrics
- **Data Quality Indicators**: Progress tracking for bootstrap and live phases

### 🚨 Alert System Improvements
- **Mode-dependent Content**: Different alert formats for optimised vs custom modes
- **Profitability Information**: Expected profit per trade for optimised mode
- **Risk Management Data**: DD limits and risk/reward ratios for custom mode
- **Simplified Format**: Single-line alerts for better webhook compatibility

### 🔄 Performance Optimizations
- **Historical Analysis**: Split validation prevents overfitting on small samples
- **Array Synchronization**: Maintains data integrity across multiple historical arrays
- **Calculation Efficiency**: Optimised statistical functions for real-time performance
- **Memory Footprint**: Efficient storage of up to 100 historical trades per asset

### 🐛 Fixed - Compilation Issues
- **Variable Scope**: Fixed undeclared identifier errors in Pine Script v6
- **Type Declarations**: Proper float type assignments for na-capable variables
- **String Concatenation**: Resolved alert formatting issues with complex strings
- **Conditional Logic**: Fixed scope issues in mode-dependent filtering
