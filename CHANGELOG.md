### In Development - Phase 1: Core Engine
- [ ] External signal ingestion system
- [ ] Historical trade tracking (up to 100 trades per asset)
- [ ] Basic TP/SL calculation engine with format.mintick precision
- [ ] Sequence analysis (TP before SL = success, SL before TP = loss)
- [ ] Modular function architecture for maintainability

### Planned - Phase 2: Statistical Analysis
- [ ] Success rate calculations (90%, 70%, 50% TP levels)
- [ ] Average drawdown computation
- [ ] Continuous learning integration
- [ ] +0.1% offset implementation with precise decimal handling
- [ ] Efficient array management for trade data

### Planned - Phase 3: Filter & Dashboard
- [ ] Three-check filter system
- [ ] Dashboard UI creation with formatted price displays
- [ ] Pass/fail status indicators
- [ ] Metrics display system using format.mintick

### Planned - Phase 4: Alerts & Features
- [ ] Discord alert formatting with dynamic price formatting
- [ ] Custom alert system with placeholders and format.mintick
- [ ] Cooldown mechanism
- [ ] Chart label system with streamlined code

### Planned - Phase 5: Code Optimization & Testing
- [ ] Code refactoring for maintainability
- [ ] Performance optimization without feature loss
- [ ] Comprehensive testing across various decimal precision assets
- [ ] Edge case handling and debugging
- [ ] Final code cleanup and documentation
