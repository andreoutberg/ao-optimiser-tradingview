## [v0.1.0] - 2025-01-08 - Phase 1: Strategy Framework Complete

### üéâ Major Milestone: Strategy Framework Implementation

**This release marks the completion of Phase 1 with a fully functional TradingView strategy framework.**

### ‚úÖ Added - Core Strategy Engine
- **Strategy-based execution**: Converted from indicator to strategy for real trade execution
- **TradingView backtester integration**: Leverages built-in strategy performance tracking
- **Multi-level TP/SL system**: Partial exits at TP1 (33%), TP2 (33%), TP3 (remaining)
- **External signal ingestion**: Supports manual, demo, and external indicator signals
- **Demo signal connector**: Auto-generates BUY/SELL signals based on price movement thresholds
- **Real-time performance tracking**: Win rate, P&L, drawdown from actual strategy execution

### ‚úÖ Added - Visual Feedback System
- **Always-visible labels**: Show every signal with filter and trade status indicators
- **Status indicators**: ‚úÖüöÄ (passed filters, trade executed) vs ‚ùå‚è∏Ô∏è (failed filters, no trade)
- **Live dashboard**: Real-time strategy metrics displayed in top-right corner
- **Debug plots**: Comprehensive data window values for development troubleshooting

### ‚úÖ Added - Filter Framework
- **Three-check filter system**: Win rate, profit, and drawdown validation
- **Testing mode**: Bypass filters for development and signal validation
- **Cooldown mechanism**: Prevent rapid-fire signal processing
- **Strategy metrics integration**: Uses actual backtest results for filtering logic

### ‚úÖ Added - Development Infrastructure
- **Modular architecture**: Clean, organized code structure for maintainability
- **Comprehensive settings**: All key parameters configurable through strategy inputs
- **Error-free compilation**: Resolved all variable declaration and syntax issues
- **Documentation**: Updated installation guide for strategy-specific usage

### üîß Technical Implementation
- **Pine Script v6**: Full compatibility with latest TradingView features
- **Strategy default settings**: 10% equity per trade, comprehensive TP/SL configuration
- **Entry offset**: 0.1% allowance for execution delay
- **Position size management**: Configurable percentage-based position sizing
- **Array-based trade tracking**: Foundation for advanced statistical analysis

### üß™ Testing & Validation
- **Demo signal generation**: Configurable threshold-based signal creation (0.1% to 5.0%)
- **Label system validation**: Confirmed visual feedback for all signal types
- **Strategy compilation**: Error-free loading and execution on TradingView
- **Basic functionality**: Signal detection, filtering, and label display working

### üìä Performance Metrics Integration
- **Real-time statistics**: Live calculation of win rates and drawdown from strategy execution
- **Built-in metrics**: Leverages strategy.closedtrades, strategy.wintrades, strategy.netprofit
- **Filter validation**: Three-check system using actual performance data
- **Dashboard display**: Live updates showing current strategy performance

### üîÑ Development Process Improvements
- **Clean codebase**: Eliminated duplicate variable declarations and compilation errors
- **Organized structure**: Clear separation of concerns with modular sections
- **Debug capabilities**: Comprehensive plotting and data window integration
- **Testing infrastructure**: Demo mode for rapid development and validation
