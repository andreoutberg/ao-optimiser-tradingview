## 🎯 Project Overview

AO Optimiser is a sophisticated TradingView Pine Script v6 indicator designed for **high-volume watchlist scanning** that analyzes external trading signals to identify optimal entry setups through advanced statistical analysis and risk management.

### 🔑 Planned Features

- **External Signal Integration**: Connects to external indicators with standardized signal format
- **Statistical Analysis Engine**: 3-tier TP level analysis (90%, 70%, 50% success rates)
- **Ultra-Selective Filtering**: Only 1-3% of scanned assets trigger alerts (3-5 alerts/day max)
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live performance metrics with PASS/FAIL indicators
- **Discord Integration**: Formatted alerts with color-coded embeds
- **Watchlist Optimized**: Efficient scanning of hundreds of assets simultaneously

## 🚀 Development Status

**⚠️ This project is in initial development phase. No stable release available yet.**

## 📊 Signal Format Standard

External indicators must output standardized signals:
- **BUY signals**: `+1` (or any positive value >= 1)
- **SELL signals**: `-1` (or any negative value <= -1)  
- **NO SIGNAL**: `0` (any value between -1 and +1)

### Integration Example
```pine
// Example for external developers:
plot(your_buy_condition ? 1 : your_sell_condition ? -1 : 0, "Signal", display=display.data_window)
```

## 🎛️ Planned Dashboard Features

### Primary Status Display
- 🔔 **Alerts**: ON/OFF status
- ✅ **TP Success Rate**: PASS (85%) / FAIL (65%)
- ✅ **TP1 Minimum Profit**: PASS (1.2%) / FAIL (0.4%)
- ✅ **Average Drawdown**: PASS (2.1%) / FAIL (5.8%)

### Enhanced Metrics (when all checks pass)
- **Trading Metrics**: TP1/TP2/TP3 success rates with trade counts
- **Overall Success Rate**: XX/100 (XX.X%)
- **Current Streak**: X wins / X losses
- **Real-time Updates**: Live calculation with each new trade

## 🚨 Planned Alert System

### Discord Integration
Alerts will be formatted for Discord webhooks with:
- **Green embeds** for BUY signals (`color: 0x00ff00`)
- **Red embeds** for SELL signals (`color: 0xff0000`)
- **Price formatting** using `str.format("{0}", value, format.mintick)`
- **Confidence levels** and performance metrics

### Alert Selectivity
**Critical**: Only the highest probability setups will trigger alerts
- Maximum 3-5 alerts per day across entire watchlist
- Strict adherence to all three filter criteria
- Quality over quantity approach

## 🔧 Development Phases

### 📋 Phase 1: Core Engine
- [ ] External signal ingestion system
- [ ] Historical trade tracking (up to 100 trades)
- [ ] Basic TP/SL calculation engine with format.mintick precision
- [ ] Sequence analysis (TP before SL logic)
- [ ] Modular function architecture

### 📊 Phase 2: Statistical Analysis
- [ ] Success rate calculations (90%, 70%, 50% TP levels)
- [ ] Average drawdown computation
- [ ] Continuous learning integration
- [ ] +0.1% offset implementation with precise decimal handling
- [ ] Efficient array management for trade data

### 🎛️ Phase 3: Filter & Dashboard
- [ ] Three-check filter system
- [ ] Dashboard UI creation with formatted price displays
- [ ] Pass/fail status indicators
- [ ] Metrics display system using format.mintick

### 🚨 Phase 4: Alerts & Features
- [ ] Discord alert formatting with dynamic price formatting
- [ ] Custom alert system with placeholders and format.mintick
- [ ] Cooldown mechanism
- [ ] Chart label system with streamlined code

### 🧹 Phase 5: Code Optimization & Testing
- [ ] Code refactoring for maintainability
- [ ] Performance optimization without feature loss
- [ ] Comprehensive testing across various decimal precision assets
- [ ] Edge case handling and debugging
- [ ] Final code cleanup and documentation

## 📈 Performance Requirements

### Watchlist Optimized
- Handle up to 100 historical trades efficiently per asset
- Process hundreds of assets simultaneously without lag
- Maintain sub-second analysis speed per cryptocurrency
- Target alert frequency: maximum 3-5 per day across entire watchlist
- Proper resource management within TradingView limits

### Filtering Effectiveness
- Alert selectivity: Only 1-3% of scanned assets trigger alerts
- False positive rate: Less than 10% of alerts fail to reach TP1
- Quality consistency: All triggered alerts meet minimum profitability standards
- Cross-asset reliability: Filters work effectively across different market caps
