# AO Optimiser - TradingView Pine Script Strategy

## 🎯 Project Overview

AO Optimiser is a sophisticated TradingView Pine Script v6 **strategy** designed for **high-volume watchlist scanning** that analyzes external trading signals to identify optimal entry setups through advanced statistical analysis and risk management.

### ✅ **Phase 1 Complete - Strategy Framework**
- **Real trade execution** using TradingView's strategy backtester
- **Multi-level TP system** (TP1, TP2, TP3 with partial exits)
- **Demo signal generation** for testing and development
- **Visual feedback system** with filter/trade status indicators
- **Real-time performance dashboard** using actual strategy metrics

### 🔑 Current Features

- **External Signal Integration**: Connects to external indicators with standardized signal format
- **Demo Signal Connector**: Auto-generates signals based on price movement thresholds
- **Strategy-Based Execution**: Real trades with built-in backtesting and performance tracking
- **Visual Labels**: Always-visible signal labels with filter and trade status
- **Live Dashboard**: Real-time metrics showing win rate, P&L, drawdown from actual trades
- **Multi-TP System**: Partial exits at TP1 (33%), TP2 (33%), TP3 (remaining)
- **Testing Mode**: Bypass filters for development and signal validation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
1. Download [`src/ao_optimiser.pine`](src/ao_optimiser.pine)
2. Open TradingView → Pine Script Editor  
3. Create new **Strategy** (not indicator)
4. Copy and paste the code
5. Save and add to chart

### Basic Testing Setup
```
Signal Source: "Demo Connector"
Demo Signal Threshold: 1.0%
Testing Mode: ON
Enable Strategy Trades: ON
Position Size: 10%
```

## 📊 Signal Format Standard

External indicators must output standardized signals:
- **BUY signals**: `+1` (or any positive value >= 1)
- **SELL signals**: `-1` (or any negative value <= -1)  
- **NO SIGNAL**: `0` (any value between -1 and +1)

### Integration Example
```pine
// Example for external developers:
plot(your_buy_condition ? 1 : your_sell_condition ? -1 : 0, "Signal", display=display.data_window)
```

## 🎮 Demo Signal Generator

Perfect for testing and development:
- **Auto-generates signals** when price moves by configurable threshold
- **BUY**: Price moves up by X% from previous bar
- **SELL**: Price moves down by X% from previous bar  
- **Adjustable threshold**: 0.1% to 5.0% (default: 1.0%)

## 🏷️ Label System

Labels **always appear** for every signal with status indicators:
- **Long ✅ 🚀** = Buy signal, filters passed, trade executed
- **Long ❌ ⏸️** = Buy signal, filters failed, no trade
- **Short ✅ 🚀** = Sell signal, filters passed, trade executed  
- **Short ❌ ⏸️** = Sell signal, filters failed, no trade

## 📊 Dashboard Features

### Real-Time Strategy Metrics
- **Trade Count**: Total completed trades
- **P&L**: Net profit/loss from actual strategy execution
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of winning trades (live calculation)
- **Max Drawdown**: Peak-to-trough decline during strategy execution
- **Filter Status**: Live PASS/FAIL indicators for the three-check system

### Three-Check Filter System
1. **Win Rate Check**: Minimum success rate threshold (default: 90%)
2. **Average Win Check**: Minimum profit per winning trade  
3. **Drawdown Check**: Maximum acceptable drawdown limit (default: 2.1%)

## 🔧 Development Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Engine (COMPLETED!)
- [x] **External signal ingestion system** (with demo connector)
- [x] **Strategy-based trade tracking** using TradingView backtester
- [x] **Multi-level TP/SL system** (TP1, TP2, TP3 with partial exits)
- [x] **Visual feedback system** (labels always show with status indicators)  
- [x] **Performance analysis** using strategy.* built-in metrics
- [x] **Modular function architecture** for maintainability

### 🔄 Phase 2: Statistical Analysis (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Enhanced TP level success rate analysis (90%, 70%, 50% targets)
- [ ] Advanced drawdown analysis during trade lifecycle
- [ ] Dynamic TP/SL optimization based on historical performance
- [ ] Cross-timeframe signal validation
- [ ] Machine learning integration for signal confidence scoring

### 📊 Phase 3: Advanced Filtering & Dashboard
- [ ] Multi-criteria filtering system with weighted scoring
- [ ] Risk-reward ratio optimization  
- [ ] Market condition adaptive filters
- [ ] Performance heatmaps and analytics
- [ ] Correlation analysis across multiple assets

### 🚨 Phase 4: Alerts & Integration
- [ ] Discord webhook integration with rich embeds
- [ ] Multi-platform alert distribution
- [ ] Custom webhook formats for different platforms
- [ ] Portfolio-level alert aggregation
- [ ] Alert rate limiting and spam prevention

### 🧹 Phase 5: Production & Optimization
- [ ] High-frequency optimization for watchlist scanning
- [ ] Memory and CPU usage optimization  
- [ ] Cross-asset compatibility testing
- [ ] Edge case handling and error recovery
- [ ] Production deployment documentation

## 📈 Performance Requirements

### Strategy Deployment Model
- **Per-chart deployment**: Each crypto gets its own strategy instance
- **Independent filtering**: Asset-specific performance analysis
- **Distributed processing**: Scalable across hundreds of assets
- **Individual cooldowns**: No cross-asset interference

### Current Capabilities
- ✅ **Real trade execution** with TradingView backtester
- ✅ **Multi-TP partial exits** for optimized profit-taking
- ✅ **Live performance tracking** with built-in metrics
- ✅ **Visual debugging** with comprehensive label system
- ✅ **Demo signal generation** for development testing

### Target Performance (Production)
- **Alert selectivity**: Only 1-3% of scanned assets trigger alerts
- **Quality consistency**: All triggered alerts meet minimum profitability standards  
- **Cross-asset reliability**: Filters work effectively across different market caps
- **Daily frequency**: Maximum 3-5 alerts per day across entire watchlist

## 🧪 Testing & Development

### Current Testing Status
- ✅ **Strategy compiles** without errors
- ✅ **Demo signals generate** automatically  
- ✅ **Labels display** with proper status indicators
- ✅ **Dashboard shows** real-time strategy metrics
- 🔧 **Strategy trades**: Minor troubleshooting in progress

### Testing Instructions
1. **Load strategy** on any crypto chart (1H timeframe recommended)
2. **Enable Demo Connector** for automatic signal generation
3. **Turn on Testing Mode** to bypass strict filters
4. **Monitor labels** for signal detection and status
5. **Check Strategy Tester** for trade execution and performance
